# Full implementation campaign

This ledger tracks the user-authorized coordinator and implementation workers.
The complete contract remains [the backend plan](dot-gen-be-plan.md). A passing
increment is not completion of the plan. All verification inputs during the
campaign are synthetic or EDG tests; real-world acceptance resumes only after
all implementation gates are met. Preserve intermediates and per-run evidence.

## Ownership and current work

| Owner | Work | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Root | Embed upstream, portable target, multi-TU, atomics and libc++ audit | Embedding complete; atomics acceptance in progress |
| Coordinator | Integration, import ABI, driver, lifecycle/heap adapters, ledger, builds/commits | In progress |
| Core language worker | Function-try-blocks, then member-pointer/full EH coverage | In progress |
| Libc worker | Audited BCL libc bridge, portable header subset, synthetic conformance | In progress |

Compiler preparation/build and Git mutations are serialized through the
coordinator. Canonical emitter sources stay in `backend/`. Workers use disjoint
files; generated overlays are refreshed only at integration boundaries.

## Completion gates

- [ ] Owned typed representation, verifier, source diagnostics and complete IL coverage.
- [ ] Versioned portable target ABI, predefined macros and headers independent of translation host.
- [ ] Complete supported C++ language, member pointers, initializer forms, atomics and extended types.
- [ ] Complete EH runtime: function-try-blocks, exception_ptr, nested exceptions, uncaught counts, matching and termination.
- [ ] NativeMemory ownership for short-lived exception/catch storage; allocation efficiency audit.
- [ ] Portable variadic ABI and compiler-assisted setjmp/longjmp.
- [ ] External function/data imports, canonical addresses and native callback adapters.
- [ ] Multi-TU semantic assembly, ODR/type identities, storage/relocations, startup and cross-module exceptions/RTTI.
- [ ] Complete libc state and services: allocation, strings, formatting, stdio, files, errno, locale, environment, time, threads, math/fenv.
- [ ] Pinned musl feasibility slice with measured adaptation and explicit provider decision.
- [ ] Pinned libc++ port including out-of-line code and all planned library families.
- [ ] Independent owner state, TLS/thread exit and disposal across every runtime subsystem.
- [ ] Windows/Linux/macOS x64/Arm64 JIT and NativeAOT validation, runtime platform selection.
- [ ] Efficiency/scalability measurements, reproducible manifests and final supported-feature audit.
- [ ] Only after all above: real-world project translation and validation.

## Verified milestones

Baseline commit `a63ae45c` embeds all 111061 original upstream tracked files and
the backend in parent Git. Original history is retained under ignored
`artifacts/embedding/upstream-history.bundle`; no nested Git remains.

Baseline evidence predates this campaign: 175 full regression checks plus ten
focused checks, recorded in `evidence/dot-gen-backend.json`. Those results prove
the documented subset only. New milestone results and commits will be recorded
here with retained artifact paths.

First integration milestone `f98f512fb` (portable target, imports, multi-TU and function-try blocks):

- `artifacts/campaign/libc-imports-final-20261002-214539/results.json`: seven
  checks, 24 C-oracle cases, static/instance JIT/NativeAOT, header and ABI probes.
- `artifacts/campaign/multitu-acceptance-001/results.json`: ten checks, C and
  C++ semantic merging, GCC/Clang C oracle, four NativeAOT configurations.
- `artifacts/campaign/function-try-shared-20261002-220203/results.json`: nine
  checks, 32 ordinary traces and three fatal traces in static/instance JIT/AOT.
- `artifacts/campaign/portable-target-acceptance-001/results.json`: nine profile
  checks covering macros, scalar/object layout, byte order and binary80.
- `artifacts/campaign/milestone-runtime-portable-20261002/results.json`: all
  209 combined regression checks pass, including NativeAOT.

First-pass exception search now uses false-returning bookkeeping filters. An
initial duplicated cleanup-switch implementation caused pathological NativeAOT
compile times; both interrupted runs and logs are retained. A single cold
per-routine decoder preserves semantics and reduces the scalar exception fixture
from over 11000 lines for its main routine alone to 2960 total generated lines.
The focused scalar exception suite passes all nine checks in 111.5 seconds.

Before the first integration commit, targeted checks additionally cover the
default portable profile, disabled implicit host headers and EDG's existing
ignore-variable predicate for dependent template entities. The full runtime
profile remains experimental; no Windows/macOS/Arm64 execution claim is made.

## Initial increment

Implement strict signature-checked `--libc dotcc` imports, including callable
external addresses and addressable errno. Reuse the generated NativeMemory heap
for C allocation and C++ new/delete. Runtime services are BCL-backed; pinning is
reserved for owner/thread errno storage, globals, TLS and existing immutable
storage. Add constructor/destructor/ordinary function-try-block differential
tests using the unchanged EDG C backend as reference.

Final first-increment supplements pass: 17 runtime/header checks at
`artifacts/campaign/default-portable-runtime/results.json`, two include-path
checks at `artifacts/campaign/portable-includes-001/results.json`, and five
variable-template checks at `artifacts/campaign/template-entities-acceptance-003/results.json`.
C++ whole-program translation now requests EDG `--instantiate used`, and the
portable profile is the driver default. See
`evidence/milestone-runtime-portable.json` for the source hashes and remaining gates.

## Second increment: native exception storage, varargs, files and atomics

The second increment passes the combined regression suite from an isolated
source/compiler snapshot at `artifacts/campaign/milestone-native-snapshot`.
The initial run preserved 555 successful command results before a strict
nullable-field warning; the corrected field is covered by the successful
complete rerun. Snapshot hashes, command logs, generated projects and all
failure evidence are retained. Focused evidence, all synthetic:

- `artifacts/campaign/exception-storage-20261002-223655/results.json`: five
  checks with GCC/Clang C-oracle agreement and static/instance JIT/NativeAOT.
  Payloads and catch adjustment cells use native memory. Explicit carrier
  disposal runs translated destructors once; finalization releases bytes only.
  Live carriers retain owners. Shutdown preserves storage while deferred
  carrier cleanup runs, including cross-thread disposal and callback reentry.
- `artifacts/campaign/libc-files-integrated-20261002-224609/results.json`:
  seven checks, 25 strict FILE imports, 11 native traces, owner-specific
  addressable standard streams and fpos, buffering, errors and concurrent
  append. Linux execution is verified; Windows/macOS branches still require
  execution on those systems.
- `artifacts/campaign/varargs-004/results.json`: ten C/C++ checks for explicit
  typed packs, default promotions, binary80/128-bit/aggregate arguments,
  va_copy/end, forwarding, recursion, indirect calls and EH. Static/instance
  JIT/NativeAOT agree with original EDG C. Packs exceeding 64 KiB use temporary
  NativeMemory; the test passes a 70 KiB pack. Arbitrary aggregate-size limits
  remain a separate unresolved representation gate.
- `artifacts/campaign/atomic-runtime-003`: isolated atomic helpers pass
  JIT/NativeAOT; `artifacts/campaign/atomic-builtins-003/results.json` adds
  twelve passing emitted C/C++ checks, including concurrent calls.

Selected musl printf source, license, provenance, replayable adaptation and
private sink are retained under `backend/runtime/musl/printf`. Its 109 native
synthetic cases pass GCC/Clang, but translated C# formatter acceptance is not
yet established. New bit-level floating helpers have separate native-vector
evidence; errno/fenv and directed arithmetic are not inferred from that proof.

Next integrated gates are member-pointer variant ABI and extended pointer EH,
formatter dependencies/translation, and libc++ component bring-up.
The complete campaign checklist above remains open.
