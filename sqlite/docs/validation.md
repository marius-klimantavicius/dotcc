# Validation evidence

Campaign commands run from `sqlite/`; scripts resolve their own absolute roots.

- `dotnet build ../dotcc.sln -c Release`: passed, zero warnings/errors, 9 seconds.
- Baseline unit suite: running, results pending.
- Baseline functional suite: pending.
- `scripts/native.sh`: 35-case deterministic core/JSON/JSONB native corpus completes;
  expected transcript checked in at `tests/native-corpus.expected`. Translated comparison pending.
- VFS worker strict GCC native suite passes; ASan+UBSan suite passes. Reproduce with
  `scripts/test-vfs-native.sh` and `SQLITE_SANITIZE=1 scripts/test-vfs-native.sh`.
  Covers direct I/O/locking/failure contracts, journal cleanup, transaction recovery,
  reopen/read-only, WAL fallback, JSONB, image export/import and resource cleanup.
- `python3 scripts/fetch.py`: archive SHA-256 verified; upstream source unchanged.
- `scripts/preprocess.sh > artifacts/sqlite3.i`: passed.
- `scripts/translate.sh`: failed at nested callback declarator; see B001.
- GCC C17 reduced nested-callback fixture: expected output `7` confirmed.

Generated artifacts/logs are ignored under `generated/`, `build/`, `artifacts/`.
No translated SQLite execution or corpus pass is claimed yet.
